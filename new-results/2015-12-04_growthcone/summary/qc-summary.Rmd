# Overview
This is a project to look at transcription in the growth cone vs. the soma,
initiated by Alexandros Poulopoulos from the Macklis lab. The experimental setup
is a little complex, there were only a small number of actual biological
replicates run but several technical replicates. The technical replicates come
in two flavors. The first is that the samples were run multiple times, there was
some overclustering problems on the lanes that lead to a low number of reads, so
the libraries were rerun. The second is that a small set of the samples only
had half of the sample loaded, the idea was to look at the quantitative range.

There are paired growthcone-soma samples that are paired via sort date, and
there are three sort dates, so there are three biological replicates. We
will block on sort date in the model.

We'll simply add the counts together for the reruns of the samples if they
look to be highly correlated and don't seem to have a batch effect. For the
half loaded samples, we only have half amplified samples for the growthcone,
and only from two two dates, Feb15 and Jun15. I don't really know how we can
use this information other than to just compare it to the non-half loaded
samples and see how well the correlation is. We'll probably drop those when
we do the analysis.

This round also includes a previous experiment with samples that were
thrown out, those samples have barcodes `group`, `group2` and `group3`.
These samples weren't separated into multiple lanes so we don't have to
do any combining of those samples.

    ```

I forgot to put the `sort_date` for the new samples and we use this for pairing
later on, so I'll add dummy values for it now.

```{r add-sort-date-for-new-samples}
load_summarydata = function() {
    summarydata = data.frame(read.table(project_summary, header=TRUE, sep=","),
                             row.names="Name", check.rows=FALSE)
    summarydata$Name = rownames(summarydata)
    summarydata = summarydata[order(summarydata$Name),]
    summarydata$sort_date = as.character(summarydata$sort_date)
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_1", "sort_date"] = "2014-group1"
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_2", "sort_date"] = "2014-group2"
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_3", "sort_date"] = "2014-group3"
    summarydata["soma_2014_1", "sort_date"] = "2014-group1"
    summarydata["soma_2014_2", "sort_date"] = "2014-group2"
    summarydata["soma_2014_3", "sort_date"] = "2014-group3"
    summarydata$sort_date = as.factor(summarydata$sort_date)
    summarydata$barcode_id = as.character(summarydata$barcode_id)
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_1", "barcode_id"] = "growthcone_2014_1"
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_2", "barcode_id"] = "growthcone_2014_2"
    summarydata["growthcone_2014_3", "barcode_id"] = "growthcone_2014_3"
    summarydata["soma_2014_1", "barcode_id"] = "soma_2014_1"
    summarydata["soma_2014_2", "barcode_id"] = "soma_2014_2"
    summarydata["soma_2014_3", "barcode_id"] = "soma_2014_3"
    summarydata$barcode_id = as.factor(summarydata$barcode_id)
    summarydata}
summarydata = load_summarydata()
```

We can see here that there is quite a bit of variation between the mapped
reads that persists across the 3 different runs. **BC9** in particular has a
very low number of reads mapped.

```{r heatmap-function}
get_heatmap_fn = function(summarydata) {
    # return the pheatmap function with or without metadata
    metadata = summarydata[, !colnames(summarydata) %in% known_columns, drop=FALSE]
    if(ncol(metadata) == 0) {
       return(pheatmap)
    }
    else {
    # rownames(metadata) = summarydata$Name
    heatmap_fn = function(data, ...) {
        pheatmap(data, annotation=metadata, ...)
    }
    return(heatmap_fn)
}}
heatmap_fn = get_heatmap_fn(summarydata)
```

# Quality control metrics

## Mapped reads
```{r mapped-plot}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x=Name, y=Mapped)) +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    ylab("mapped reads") + xlab("")
    ```

We can see here that there is quite a bit of variation between the mapped
reads that persists across the 3 different runs. **BC9** and **BC14**in
particular have a very low number of reads mapped. For the new run
**growthcone_2014_1** and **soma_2014_1** both look poor.

## Genomic mapping rate
```{r mapping-rate-plot}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x=Name, y=Mapping.Rate)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    ylab("mapping rate") + xlab("") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
          ```

Mapping rate is a better metric of if there is something wrong with the libraries.
Here we see that **BC14** and **BC9** look pretty bad for their mapping rate but
overall the mapping rate is lower than we would expect, we'd normally be expecting
about 90% of the reads to map. This could be due to some kind of adapter contamination
issues we are not addressing when making the samples. What kit was used to make these libraries? What adapter sequences can we expect to see on the end
of the sequences?

In the new samples, **growthcone_2014_1** and **soma_2014_1** look fine in terms
of mapping rate.

We can see from the above plot that in general the growthcone libraries have a
poorer mapping rate than the non-growthcone libraries. This holds true for
the new samples as well.

## Number of genes detected
```{r genes-detected-plot}
dd = data.frame(Name=names(counts), Genes.Detected = colSums(counts > 0))
ggplot(dd, aes(x=Name, y=Genes.Detected)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    ylab("genes detected") + xlab("")
    ```

We detect on average less genes in the growthcone libraries, this might make sense if there are only a subset of the genes in the growthcones. This would be a more convincing argument if there was not one growthcone sample **BC10** that has a high number of genes deteceted. We can see **growthcone_2014_1** and **soma_2014_1** have a low number of
genes detected. These libraries probably did not work.

## Gene detection saturation
```{r saturation-plot}
dd = data.frame(Mapped=summarydata$Mapped, Genes.Detected = colSums(counts > 0))
ggplot(dd, aes(x=Mapped, y=Genes.Detected)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    ylab("genes detected") + xlab("reads mapped")
```
This plot is to help us figure out if we are saturating the number of genes
robustly detected in sequencing. Here we called detected as having counts > 10,
rather than counts > 0. It looks like both the growthcone and the soma
libraries cap out at the same rate, which is not what we would be expecting
if the growthcone libraries were a smaller set of RNA than the soma libraries.

## Exonic mapping rate
```{r exonic-mapping-plot}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x=Name, y=Exonic.Rate)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    ylab("exonic mapping rate") + xlab("")
```
Another way to determine what went wrong with the sequencing is to look at the
rate mapped reads map to exons. Here we see that for BC9 of the reads that map,
a small amount map to exons. This, coupled with the low mapping rate generally
indicates there was very little RNA in this sample and most of what got sequenced
was either adapter sequence or genomic DNA.

## rRNA mapping rate
```{r rRNA-rate-plot}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x=Name, y=rRNA_rate)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    ylab("rRNA rate") + xlab("")
```
rRNA mapping rate is reasonable for all the samples. Again we see **BC9** with
a very small rate, since it seems like whatever is mapping in there is not
from RNA. **growthcone_2014_1** and **soma_2014_1** don't have off the charts
rRNA mapping, so the problems with the libraries is not due to rRNA contamination.
I think most likely there was very little RNA in the samples left when those two
libraries were made.

## Estimated fragment length of paired-end reads
```{r fragment-length-plot}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x=Name, y=Fragment.Length.Mean)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
    ylab("fragment length") + xlab("")
```
We can see more problems with BC9-- the fragment size is very large, that means
we likely had large pieces of DNA leftover that the libraries were made from.
We can also see some problems with BC14, the estimated fragment length is negative.
This means that the average fragment length is less than the read length, which is
an indication of degraded RNA. That might be why this sample looks a little
worse than the others.

When we look at BC9, about 40% of the sequence is Truseq adapter sequence.
We trim this off during our processing, so these usually indicate stacks
of Truseq sequence when mulitple copies are stacked together.
The BC14 samples, about 10% is is taken up by the Truseq adapater.
Good libraries like BC10 don't have the sequence.

All of these lines of evidence point towards BC9 not having RNA in the sample
and BC14 having degraded RNA.

**growthcone_2014_1** and **soma_2014_1** likely have a very non-complex
library; so there is a small amount of RNA in the tube, but it is made up of
the transcripts from a small number of genes.

## Boxplot of log10 counts per gene
```{r boxplot-raw}
melted = melt(counts)
colnames(melted) = c("sample", "count")
melted$sample = factor(melted$sample)
melted = melted[order(melted$sample),]
melted$count = log(melted$count)
ggplot(melted, aes(x=sample, y=count)) + geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) + xlab("")
```

## Boxplot of log10 TMM-normalized counts per gene
Trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization is described
[here](http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R25)

Robinson, M. D., & Oshlack, A. (2010). A scaling normalization method for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. Genome Biology, 11(3). doi:10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25

```{r boxplot-normalized}
y = DGEList(counts=counts)
y = calcNormFactors(y)
normalized_counts = cpm(y, normalized.lib.sizes=TRUE)
melted = melt(normalized_counts)
colnames(melted) = c("gene", "sample", "count")
melted$sample = factor(melted$sample)
melted = melted[order(melted$sample),]
melted$count = log(melted$count)
ggplot(melted, aes(x=sample, y=count)) + geom_boxplot() +
    theme_bw(base_size=10) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) + xlab("")
```
Normalizing the counts by TMM-normalization can't fully normalize the samples.

## PCA plot
```{r pca}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=summarydata, design=~Name)
vst = varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
pca = plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("compartment"), return=TRUE)
ggplot(pca, aes(PC1, PC2, color=group, label=name)) + geom_text(size=4) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
```
Here we can see that the `BC9` and `BC14` libraries cluster apart from the other
growthcone libraries. These are
likely because these libraries both have issues with adapter contamination that
are symtpoms of having a low RNA content. Dropping these samples seems prudent.
The `BC6` sample also looks
like it is an outlier from the other samples in the PCA plot, but it is different
than the `BC9` and `BC14` samples. The `BC6` sample was the other sample with a
very low number of genes detected. This sample doesn't have the same
adapter contamination issue, but the GC content looks out of whack with
a huge spike in the mean GC content instead of an even distribution. We can also
see that the `growthcone_2014_1` and `soma_2014_1` samples cluster with the
`BC9` and `BC14` samples, which looked like they failed.

The `BC6` library looks like it is less complex than the other libraries,
when we look at the sequence duplication plots. As an extreme example, lets look
a the duplication plot for `BC9`:

![BC9 duplication](images/BC9-duplication.png)

`BC9` was mostly adapter sequence and we can see there are reads that are duplicated
over 10k times. For an example of what a good library looks like, lets look at
`BC10`:

![BC10 duplication](images/BC10-duplication.png)

It is normal to see some duplication in RNA-seq just because there is only 2% of
the genome that is sequenced, so you should see some duplication, just not sequences
with a crazy amount.

`BC6` has a big spike:

![BC6 duplication](images/BC6-duplication.png)

A sample that was like `BC6` in terms of reads mapped and mapping percentage
is `BC5`. That sample doesn't have as much of a prominent spike:

![BC5 duplication](images/BC5-duplication.png)

These are all growthcone libraries. So the question is, is this sample what we are expecting to see when we look at the growthcones, a low number of genes detected? Or are the other samples where we see a high number of genes detected what we expect. I think
that the BC6 library probably also had low RNA content, just not as low as BC9
and BC14, but it is still problematic. So going forward I'm going to drop BC9,
BC14 and BC6 from the analysis. Hopefully that leaves us with enough data
to do something with. I won't dig to try to find out why the `growthcone_2014_1` and
`soma_2014_1` samples in this followup report look bad, we'll just drop them.

The BC6 and BC5 samples are the two samples that are in the half loaded group,
so I think the takehome is don't do that in the future.

```{r drop-bad-samples}
bad_samples = c("BC9", "BC14", "BC6", "growthcone_2014_1", "soma_2014_1")
summarydata = subset(summarydata, !barcode_id %in% bad_samples)
counts = counts[, colnames(counts) %in% rownames(summarydata)]
```

## PCA plot with filtered samples
```{r pca-filtered}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=summarydata, design=~Name)
vst = varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
pca = plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("compartment"), return=TRUE)
ggplot(pca, aes(PC1, PC2, color=group, label=name)) + geom_text(size=4) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
```

There is some variability by sort date. The Feb15 samples separate out from
the other samples along the 2nd principal component by sort date:

```{r sort-date-pca}
plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("sort_date", "starting_material"))
```

Unfortunately the growthcone sample from Feb15, the only sample that survived is
BC5, which is the last remaining half loaded sample, so we might be making
some apples to oranges type comparison with that one.

We can see the amount of starting material has an effect for the Feb15 soma
samples but not so much for the Oct14 samples. We can just drop the
samples with starting material = 50 for those.

```{r pca-start-date-filtered}
summarydata = subset(summarydata, is.na(starting_material) || !starting_material == 50)
counts = counts[, rownames(summarydata)]
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=summarydata, design=~Name)
vst = varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
pca = plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("compartment"), return=TRUE)
ggplot(pca, aes(PC1, PC2, color=group, label=name)) + geom_text(size=4) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("sort_date", "starting_material"))
```

## Final touches
To recap we're left with samples that separate like this on the PCA:

```{r final-pca}
pca = plotPCA(vst, intgroup = c("compartment"), return = TRUE)
 ggplot(pca, aes(PC1, PC2, color = group, label = name)) + geom_text(size = 4) +
     theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "grey"),
     axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

Each of those are groups of three from each run; the runs almost perfectly
overlap so it is safe to combine them into one set of counts for each
library. We'll construct sample summary information and a count matrix of those
combined samples. For the counts we'll just add the counts together for each
run.

```{r finalize-counts}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
fcounts = counts
fcounts$id = rownames(fcounts)
melted = melt(fcounts)
melted = merge(melted, summarydata, by.x="variable", by.y="Name")
grouped = melted %>% group_by(id, barcode_id) %>% summarise(value=sum(value))
combined = grouped %>% spread(barcode_id, value)
combined = data.frame(combined)
rownames(combined) = combined$id
combined$id = NULL
fsummary = summarydata
fsummary = fsummary[, colnames(fsummary) != "Name"]
rownames(fsummary) = NULL
fsummary = fsummary[, c("barcode", "barcode_id", "compartment", "half_amplified", "sort_date")]
fsummary = unique(fsummary)
rownames(fsummary) = fsummary$barcode_id
fsummary$Name = rownames(fsummary)
counts = combined
summarydata = fsummary
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=summarydata, design=~Name)
vst = varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
plotPCA(vst, intgroup=c("compartment"))
original_counts = counts
```

```{r de-setup}
library(DESeq2)
library(DEGreport)
library(vsn)
design = ~sort_date+compartment
condition = "compartment"
```

and samples that look like this:

```{r final-samples, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(summarydata)
```

We're a little stuck because one of the Feb15 samples is the half amplified
sample so we're comparing apples to oranges a little bit there.

# Differential expression
For diffential expression we'll drop all genes that have aren't expressed
in any of the samples, and analyze them with DESeq2, running a paired analysis
looking at the effect of **compartment**, doing a paired analysis comparing only samples sorted on the same date to each other.
```{r deseq2-expression-analysis, results='asis'}
design = ~sort_date+compartment
counts = counts[rowSums(counts>0)>1,]
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, colData=summarydata, design = design)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```

## Effect of variance stabilization

```{r deseq-diagnostics, results='asis'}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
notAllZero <- (rowSums(counts(dds))>0)
rld <- rlog(dds)
vsd <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
rlogMat <- assay(rld)
vstMat <- assay(vsd)

meanSdPlot(log2(counts(dds,normalized=TRUE)[notAllZero,] + 1),
           ylim = c(0,2.5))
meanSdPlot(assay(rld[notAllZero,]), ylim = c(0,2.5))
meanSdPlot(assay(vsd[notAllZero,]), ylim = c(0,2.5))

```

## Dispersion estimates

```{r dispersion-estimate}
plotDispEsts(dds)
```

```{r deseq2-handler}
handle_deseq2 = function(dds, summarydata, column) {
  all_combs = combn(levels(summarydata[,column]), 2, simplify=FALSE)
  all_results = list()

  for(comb in all_combs) {
    contrast_string = paste(comb, collapse=" vs ")
    contrast = c(column, comb)
    res = results(dds, contrast=contrast)
    res = res[order(res$padj),]
    all_results = c(all_results, res)
    contrast_strings = c(contrast_strings, contrast_string)
  }
  names(all_results) = contrast_strings
  return(all_results)
}
```

## MA-plots

```{r DESeq-output, results='asis'}
all_results = handle_deseq2(dds, summarydata, condition)
len = length(all_results)
nr = ceiling( len / 3 )
nc = ceiling( len / nr )
par(mfrow=c(nr,nc))

  stats = as.data.frame(all_results[[i]][,c(2,6)])
  p = volcano_density_plot(stats, title=names(all_results)[i], lfc.cutoff=1.5)
  print(p)
}
```

## DEGreport

```{r get-groups}
get_groups <- function(d, comp, condition)
{
  g <- unlist(strsplit(comp," "))
  g1 <- d$Name[d[, (names(d)==condition)]==g[1]]
  g2 <- d$Name[d[, (names(d)==condition)]==g[3]]
  list(g1,g2)
}
```

### Pvalues-vs-Mean
Here we plot some information about how the p-values are correlated with the
mean or the standard deviation. For these, within each quantile we should see
an even distribution. We should see an encrichment for lower p-values if
there is a set of genes differentially expressed and we see that as well.

```{r DEGreport-M}
plots = list()
scale_factor = round(1/nr * 14)
for(i in seq(length(all_results))) {
  plots[[i]] = degMean(all_results[[i]]$pvalue, rlogMat) +
  theme_bw(base_size = scale_factor) +
  ggtitle(paste0("Pvalues-vs-Mean for ", names(all_results)[i]))
}
do.call(grid.arrange,plots)
```

### Pvalues-vs-Variation

## Differentially expressed genes
Finally, we'll take the sets of differentially expressed genes and do
some work with them. We'll attach some metadata about the genes
to each gene and we'll do some gene set enrichment analyses to see if
certain sets of genes are differentially regulated.

There are `r sum(res$padj < 0.1, na.rm=TRUE)` differentially expressed genes.
`r sum(res$padj < 0.1 & res$log2FoldChange > 0, na.rm=TRUE)` are higher
in the growthcones compared to the soma and
`r sum(res$padj < 0.1 & res$log2FoldChange < 0, na.rm=TRUE)`
are lower in the growthcones compared to the soma.

Many of these differentially expressed genes we see only in the growthcone:

```{r growthcone-specific, results='asis'}
diff = rownames(subset(res, padj < 0.1))
knitr::kable(res[diff[rowSums(counts[diff,soma_samples]) == 0],])
```

and only in the soma:

```{r soma-specific, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(res[diff[rowSums(counts[diff,gc_samples]) == 0],])
```

Many of these are not genes that are just expressed at a low level. Many of
them are in the upper quartile of the expression levels, so this isn't
just a case of a gene getting missed because it is expressed at a low level. Here
are the quartiles of baseMean:

```{r basemean-quartiles}
summary(res$baseMean)
```

I wrote out three lists, the Ensembl gene IDs of genes that are up
in the growthcones, the IDs that are down and the IDs that are expressed,
where expressed has a DESeq2 assigned baseMean expression level of 10 or greater.

```{r go-analysis-setup}
up_gc = rownames(subset(res, log2FoldChange > 0, padj < 0.05))
write.table(up_gc, file="up-growthcone-ensembl-ids.txt", quote=FALSE,
            row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
down_gc = rownames(subset(res, log2FoldChange < 0, padj < 0.05))
write.table(down_gc, file="down-growthcone-ensembl-ids.txt", quote=FALSE,
            row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
expressed = rownames(subset(res, baseMean > 10))
write.table(expressed, file="expressed-ensembl-ids.txt", quote=FALSE,
            row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

As an example of what you can do with this data,
I popped the gene lists into [WebGestalt](http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt), separating them into up and down gene lists. I focused on the list of genes that
were enriched in the growthcones, using the set of expressed genes as
a background.

![](images/final_DAG_file_1449889165.gif)

I included four lists of genes
that you can use with these tools. The first list is of genes that are expressed,
which I definied as having at least 10 counts total across all of the samples. The
second list is a list of all of the differentially expressed genes, using
a FDR cutoff of 0.05. If you don't care about the direction of expression, you
can load the DE list and then use the list of expressed genes as a background list
for the enrichment tools. The two other lists are the DE list, but separated
into up in growthcone or down in growthcone compared to the soma. You can use
those lists similarly to look at genes specifically enriched or
depleted from the growthcones. These are all Ensembl gene identifiers.

Those differentially expressed files and the expressed files are
tarred up [here](https://github.com/hbc/poulopoulos-growthcone-rnaseq/raw/master/growthcone/final/2015-11-14_growthcone/summary/poulopoulos-de-results.tar)

## Previous results
We should hopefully see the new results with more replicates are
similar to the previous results.

```{r previous-to-current}
prev_results = read.table("deseq2_results_original.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
prev_up = rownames(subset(prev_results, padj < 0.1 & log2FoldChange > 0))
current_up = rownames(subset(res, padj < 0.1 & log2FoldChange > 0))
table(prev_up %in% current_up)
```
Of the ~240 genes up in the growthcones in the previous run, we see 190 of them
in the run with the old samples added so there is some differences but the
main effects are there.

## lncRNA
A question came up in Basecamp if any of the genes enriched in the growthcones
are lncRNA. I added the biotype and gene symbol to the results and made a
table of the enriched in growthcone biotypes.

```{r add-biotypes}
biotype_matches = match(rownames(res), conversions$ensembl_gene_id)
res$biotype = conversions[biotype_matches,]$gene_biotype
res$symbol = conversions[biotype_matches,]$gene_symbol
knitr::kable(data.frame(table(subset(res, padj < 0.1 & log2FoldChange > 0)$biotype)))
```

## Summary
The results seem reasonable to me, being relatively enriched for RNA encoding
ribosomal proteins makes a lot of sense for the growthcones. The data looks
reasonable in terms of quality, with the caveats I talked about above. The
growthcone data is widely variable, and future experiments might do well
to do more replicates to have more power.

```{r write-results}
write.table(res, file="results_de.tsv", sep="\t", quote=FALSE,
            row.names=TRUE, col.names=TRUE)
```
